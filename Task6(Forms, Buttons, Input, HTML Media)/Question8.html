    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fish are fascinating and diverse creatures that inhabit various aquatic
      environments, from the deep, dark depths of the ocean to the tranquil
      waters of freshwater lakes and rivers. With over 30,000 species known to
      science, fish display an astounding range of shapes, sizes, and colors,
      each adapting to their specific environments and lifestyles. Many fish
      possess unique features that aid in their survival; for instance, some
      have developed bioluminescence to attract mates or lure prey, while
      others, like the pufferfish, can inflate themselves as a defense
      mechanism.
