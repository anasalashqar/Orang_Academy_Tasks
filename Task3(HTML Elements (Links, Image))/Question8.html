      <mark>is an interdisciplinary field that combines</mark> principles from
      both electrical engineering and computer science. It focuses on the
      design, development, and application of computer systems, software, and
      hardware. The foundation of computer engineering lies in understanding how
      computers work from the ground up, including both the physical components
      like processors, memory, and circuit boards, and the software that allows
      the hardware to function. A computer engineer is tasked with designing
      microprocessors, embedded systems, networks, and even entire computing
      infrastructures that power everything from smartphones to supercomputers.
      The field is expansive, touching on areas like artificial intelligence,
      robotics,
      <u
