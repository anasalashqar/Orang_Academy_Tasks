      Fishes are the oldest vertebrates, with fossils dating back over 500
      million years. Some species of fish can live for decades, with certain
      types of koi carp reaching over 200 years old. Fishes have a highly
      developed sense of hearing, and some species can even hear sounds from
      miles away under water.
