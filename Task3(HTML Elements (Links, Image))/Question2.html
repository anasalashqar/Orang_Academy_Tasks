    <h2>The Main Difference Between HTML and CSS</h2>
    <h4>The main difference between HTML and CSS is that while HTML defines the structure of web pages, CSS is used to style those pages with a variety of different features. If we think of HTML code as the skeleton of a web page, CSS would be its skin.</h4>

    <h4>Other differences between HTML and CSS include:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML consists of text contained within HTML tags, while CSS is made up of declaration blocks and selectors.</li>
        <li>Where HTML gives a web browser display information of various tags, CSS enhances that information to the browser by adding styling to those HTML tags.</li>
        <li>CSS can be used inside an HTML document, but HTML cannot be used inside a CSS sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS is used for presentation and visual effect—to manipulate colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual style to sites, prepare images, specify margins and borders, and much more—while HTML is not.</li>
    </ul>
